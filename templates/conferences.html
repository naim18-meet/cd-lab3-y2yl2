    <p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 24px">The QASMUN Conference this year will take place on February 27, 2018. It is a 1 day conference and therefore we will be taking primarily 10th and 9th graders. We will be scattered across many committees and there will be 3 advisors (who will also be chairs in two different comittees). This conference will be a great experience for beginners in the club and will help you gain much needed expereince and confidence in your MUN skills. This conference is a great opportunity to expand your knowledge in MUN and we encourage all 9th graders to attend it! Delegate and transportation fees will be announced once more information is given to use regarding the conference...</p>

    <h1 style="font-family: Times; font-size: 30px; color: #f15025">ROSMUN Conference 2018</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 24px">The ROSMUN Conference this year will take place on April 11-12, 2018 at the Rosary Sisters' High School in Jerusalem. Due to the fact that conference will be held in East Jerusalem, we will not recieve any subsidies from the government and therefore will have to pay the transportation fees in full. All 11th graders (with the exception of a few who will be chairs) will be delegates in the conference. 12th graders will be chairs in the different committees, and there might be a chance some 10th graders will be delegates this year as well. It is expected that all students from the club will be fully supportive of our delegation and take an active role inmaking sure the conference run smoothly. We will have delegates scattered in all of the committees. There will be training sessions before the conference is held, and you are all encouraged to attend them and/or help organize them. Every year our delegation stands out in that conference and we are looking forward to more of that this year!</p>
